I am a PhD student in computer science since October, 2016. I am interested in
machine learning, statistics and computational neuroscience. I work on text
processing, statistical methods and predictive models for large-scale automated
analysis of the neuroscience scientific literature . I am part of
the [Parietal team](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/)
at [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/), and I work under the supervision
of
[Gaël Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info),
[Fabian Suchanek](https://suchanek.name)
(from [Télécom ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng))
and
[Bertrand Thirion](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/team-members/bertrand-thirions-page/).
