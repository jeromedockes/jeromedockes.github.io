I am a post-doc in computer science at the [Montreal Neurological
Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/) since February, 2020. I am working with
[JB Poline](https://www.mcgill.ca/qls/researchers/jb-poline) and [Gaël
Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info). I am interested in machine learning,
statistics and computational neuroscience.

Druing my thesis, I worked on statistical methods and predictive models for
large-scale automated analysis of the neuroscience scientific literature . I was
part of the [Parietal team](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/) at
[INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/en/), and I worked under the supervision of [Fabian
Suchanek](https://suchanek.name) (from [Télécom
ParisTech](https://www.telecom-paristech.fr/eng)), [Gaël
Varoquaux](http://gael-varoquaux.info) and [Bertrand
Thirion](https://team.inria.fr/parietal/team-members/bertrand-thirions-page/).
